web3.eth.filter and web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address).MyEvent() are both ways to work with logs/events,
Which one is more common to use? Can you give an example use case for each?

    -- web3.eth.filter streams all blockHashes of new mined blocks; also streams txObjects for 'pending' block.
    -- Can also filter for specific topics (Event Hash, or other event args) in specific blocks/ranges, for a particular address.

    -- web3.eth.contract....MyEvent is a helper function on top of filter,
    -- for a specific event associated with a particular contract address.

How often does one filter.stopWatching after the first received event?   Percentage wise?

What scenarios might one let events stream for a while before stopping them?

Is web3.reset() employed often for clearing all active event callbacks?  I imagine it's more typical to assign an event and stop it directly?

How often do you employ filter.get()?  Do you have an example of how you've used this in real life?
